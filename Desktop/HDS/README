lock.h - implementation of pthread_rwlock_t
rwlocktest.h - test suite for validation
test.cpp - src file for test suite

A simple implementation of pthread_rwlock with no optimization for thread starvations or scheduling priority. 

Test suite - Three versions of global increment. 5 writer threads and 2 readers threads spawned within each version. writer works on a loop of 100000 iterations so final updated value should be 500000 

run 'make' - binary is 'rwlocks' 

compiled with g++ compiler. 

NOTE: in some cases, version with no lock will produce the desired result. Multiple runs of binary will vary the result
